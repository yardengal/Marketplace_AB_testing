# AB_testing

Hypothesis testing is the procedure for deciding whether the results of a research study support a particular theory that applies to a population. The A/B testing is a user experience research methodology for making gradual but important changes in the business. This project was done as a part of data analysis studies. it shows an A/B test for a fictional company named 'Globox', where I analyzed the results and provided recommendations to the stakeholders about whether the company should expand the experiment to all their users and launch a new web page.
