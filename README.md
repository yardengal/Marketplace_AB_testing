# AB_testing

Hypothesis testing is the procedure for deciding whether the results of a research study support a particular theory that applies to a population. The A/B testing is a user experience research methodology for making gradual but important changes in the business. 

Introduction to the background of the project:
GloBox is an online marketplace that specializes in sourcing unique and high-quality products from around the world. GloBox is primarily known amongst its customer base for boutique fashion items and high-end decor products. However, their food and drink offerings have grown tremendously in the last few months, and the company wants to bring awareness to this product category to increase revenue.
The Growth team decided to run an A/B test that highlights key products in the food and drink category as a banner at the top of the website. The control group does not see the banner, and the test group does.
This project was done as a part of data analysis studies. it shows an A/B test for the company, where I analyzed the results and provided recommendations to the stakeholders about whether the company should expand the experiment to all their users and launch the new banner.
